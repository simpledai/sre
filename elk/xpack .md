X-Pack is an Elastic Stack extension that bundles security, alerting, monitoring, reporting, and graph capabilities into one easy-to-install package.

Prior to Elasticsearch 5.0.0, you had to install separate Shield, Watcher, and Marvel plugins to get the features that are bundled together in X-Pack.

With X-Pack, you no longer have to worry about whether or not you have the right version of each plugin,

just install the X-Pack for the Elasticsearch version you’re running)

X-Pack是Elastic技术栈的扩展，它集安全，提醒，监控，报表以及图标功能于一体。


xpack有很多功能，比如说：安全、告警、监控(监控是指监控自身)
